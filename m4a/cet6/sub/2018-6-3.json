  "Value": "This dance somehow told the other honeybees where the food was, because after the dance, some of the bees flew from the hive straight to the site of the food. Von Frisch called the bees that collect the food forager bees. He thought the scout bee's dance told the forager bees three thingsâ€”first, the smell of the food it had found; second, which direction to fly to reach the food; and third, the distance of the food site from the beehive."
