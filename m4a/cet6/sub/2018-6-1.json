}, {
  "StartTime": 314.38,
  "EndTime": 323.47,

  "Value": "Which type would you recommend?"
}, {

}, {
  "StartTime": 337.29,
  "EndTime": 344.05,
  "Value": "There are generally more popular than whites and can usually be paired with food more easily."
}, {
  "StartTime": 344.05,
  "EndTime": 351.04,
  "Value": "Our specialty here are Italian wines and these tend to be fruity with medium acidity."
}, {
  "StartTime": 351.04,
  "EndTime": 358.14,
  "Value": "This one here is a Chianti which is perhaps Italy's most famous type of red wine."
}, {
  "StartTime": 358.14,
  "EndTime": 366,
  "Value": "Alternatively you may wish to try and surprise your boss with something less common, such as this Zinfandel."
}, {
  "StartTime": 366,
  "EndTime": 375.29,
  "Value": "The grapes are originally native to Croatia, but this winery is in eastern Italy, and it has a more spicy and peppery flavour."
}, {
  "StartTime": 375.29,
  "EndTime": 382.4,
  "Value": "So to summarize, the Chianti is more classical, and the Zinfandel more exciting."
