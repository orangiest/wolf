}, {
  "StartTime": 1394.19,
  "EndTime": 1403.51,

  "Value": "Here we have three of the most important problems facing small businesses that I want to look at today."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1410.89,
  "EndTime": 1427.84,
  "Value": "First, keeping up with the pace of technological change, recruiting high quality staff in a time of skills shortages in IT as a whole and in a highly competitive market, and the issue of retaining staff once they've been recruited and trained."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1427.84,
  "EndTime": 1433.48,
  "Value": "Now, all of these problems involve significan't costs for all businesses."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1433.48,
  "EndTime": 1439.4,
  "Value": "But there are particularly challenging issues for small- and medium-sized enterprises."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1439.4,
  "EndTime": 1444.84,
  "Value": "And those costs would vary depending on the size and scale of the businesses."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1444.84,
  "EndTime": 1452.4,
  "Value": "So let's come to the first issue on our list which is keeping pace with developments in technology."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1452.4,
  "EndTime": 1468.43,
  "Value": "Now we all know that the technology industry is intensely competitive with new products being launched all year round as the various companies strive to compete with each other, rather than, say once a year or every couple of years."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1468.43,
  "EndTime": 1471.45,
  "Value": "And this is a real headache for smaller businesses."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1471.45,
  "EndTime": 1476.73,
  "Value": "So,let's imagine we have a small company which is doing OK."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1476.73,
  "EndTime": 1482.36,
  "Value": "It's just about making a profit and it spends most of its income on overheads."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1482.36,
  "EndTime": 1493.28,
  "Value": "So for a company in this situation, keeping up to date with the latest technology, even if it's only for the benefit of key staff, this can be hugely expensive."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1493.28,
  "EndTime": 1507.32,
  "Value": "So in my view, some creative thinking needs to come in here to find ways to help companies in this situation to stay ahead in the game, but at the same time, to remain technologically competitive."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1507.32,
  "EndTime": 1524.63,
  "Value": "Well, there's a possibility that small groups of companies with similar requirements but not directly competing with each other, they could share the cost of upgrading in much the same way as, let's say, an intranet operates within large organizations."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1524.63,
  "EndTime": 1531.73,
  "Value": "In fact, cost-sharing could be a very practical solution, especially in times of financial difficulty."
}, {
  "StartTime": 1531.73,
  "EndTime": 1541.6,
  "Value": "If there's downward pressure on costs, because of a need for investment in other areas, I would argue that this is a perfectly feasible solution."
